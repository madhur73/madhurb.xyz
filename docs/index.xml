      <description>Animals Becoming conscious of the impact my decisions have on this planet and other living beings and eating only whole food plant based diet has been one of the best decisions I made thus far in my life.
I think everyone has a choice nowadays of what they can eat and animal suffering can be avoided.
Sharing I love sharing things I make and I am open about most things I do and like.</description>
