👋 I love [making](../projects) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing) things I have built with the world.

📚 Building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), an [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website for [learning any topic as fast as possible](https://docs.learn-anything.org/roadmap).

🖋 I love writing. You can read [all the articles](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles) I wrote on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) or take a look through [my personal wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) where I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/everything-I-know).

🌐 I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev). I share my [code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github) on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) and you can see photos I took on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev).

🎥 I also make educational [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw) and share [music playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev).

💻 I am passionate about [macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) so I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

🐛 If you want to know even more about me, you can see [what I like](../likes) and [explore my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) or even [search through it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind), if you like.

💚 You can support what I do on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev). Thank you.

💬 Feel free to [ask me anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ama) or [send a message](mailto:nikita.voloboev@gmail.com) if you want to make a new friend. [PGP key](https://keybase.io/nikitavoloboev).
